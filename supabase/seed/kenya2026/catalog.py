"""
MarketPips — Kenya 2026 researched market catalog (single source of truth).

All content is grounded in live July-2026 reporting (Gachagua impeachment + DCP,
Finance Bill 2026 / Tax Amendments Bill, AFCON 2027 co-hosting, Arbantone music
wave, BTC ~$66k, Housing Levy anger, inflation ~6.7%). Titles are deliberately
SHORT and explicit (Polymarket style). Probabilities are the seeder's initial
"house" priors (a quant's honest read), not certainties.

Image strategy — every market cover and every multi-outcome option carries an
(entity_kind, entity_ref) that the backfill resolver can ALWAYS fetch:
  person  -> Wikipedia page title      (photo)
  company -> primary domain            (favicon/logo)
  crypto  -> CoinGecko coin id         (token mark)
  place   -> ISO-3166-1 alpha-2        (flag)
No abstract/unimageable options are used, so there are no placeholders.

NOW = 2026-07-23 (EAT). Dates below are chosen to be live (open) markets that
resolve between Aug 2026 and Aug 2027, plus a few already-resolved ones so the
"Closed/Resolved" surfaces are populated.
