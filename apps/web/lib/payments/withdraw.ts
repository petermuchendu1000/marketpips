// Withdrawal helper (server-only)
//
// The single chokepoint for the payout lifecycle. Pure, testable fee/limit
// logic lives here alongside thin wrappers over the atomic + idempotent
// withdrawal RPCs (migration 006):
//
//   requestWithdrawal()  → request_withdrawal  (reserve, atomic)
//   completeWithdrawal() → complete_withdrawal (release reserve, idempotent)
//   failWithdrawal()     → fail_withdrawal     (refund, idempotent)
//
// Do NOT hand-roll wallet/withdrawal/transaction updates in a route or a
// webhook — always funnel through here so atomicity + idempotency hold and the
// reserve → complete/fail invariant can never be violated.
