// lib/security/route-protection.ts — pure edge auth-gate decisions.
//
// Extracted from middleware.ts so the routing rules that decide "does this
// request need a logged-in user?" are unit-testable in isolation (the
// middleware itself pulls in next/server and a live Supabase client, so it
// can't run under vitest). Keep this file framework-free.
//
// History / regression guard: `/api/markets` used to live in the fully-gated
// list with a "POST only" comment, but the prefix check gated EVERY method —
// so anonymous GETs to the PUBLIC market reads (`/api/markets`,
// `/api/markets/[id]`, `/api/markets/[id]/book`, `/api/markets/[id]/
// price-history`) 307-redirected to /auth/login. The client order-book fetch
// then parsed the login HTML as JSON, failed, and NO market ever showed its
// order book for logged-out visitors. Reads on those prefixes are public; the
// write handlers still enforce auth/RBAC themselves.
